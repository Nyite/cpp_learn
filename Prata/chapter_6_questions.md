1. In version 2 the 2nd `if` will only be evaluated if the first `if` is `false`.

    Where in version 1 the 2nd will be allways be evaluated (even if it's already known that `ch == ' '`)

2. `++ch` is `char` and `ch + 1` is int. So they will be displayed differently.

3. Console log will look like this:

    ```C++
    Hi!

    HHii!!Send $10 or $20 now!
    Sseenndd  ct1 = 9, ct2 = 0
    
    ```
